# Weather Dashboard

## Description:
This project consists on a weather dashboard where the user can search for the desired city and it presents the current and future weather conditions (5-day forecast) for that city. The dashboard also saves previous searches, so the user is able to click on a city in the search history, and they will again be presented with the current and future weather conditions for that city.
